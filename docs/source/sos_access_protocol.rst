SOS Access v4 Protocol
======================

SOS Access V4 protocol is intended for transmission of alarm signals between
alarm transmitters and receivers.

Functions for monitoring the transmission link are included.

It is an XML based protocol and only printable 8-bits characters from
ISO8859-1 are allowed.

The protocol consists of the following message types:

Alarm Requests
--------------

<alarmrequest>
    Alarm, reset or information message
<alarmresponse>
    Response message for <alarmrequests>

Change password
---------------

<requestnewauthentication>
    Request new password
<requestnewauthenticationresponse>
    Response message for <requestnewauthentication> messages, containing the
    new password

Monitored Links
---------------

<pingrequest>
    Hearbeat message from the alarm transmitter
<pingresponse>
    Response message for <pingrequest>


Client Implementation
---------------------

In the sos-access client the messages are modeled by the following classes

.. module:: sos_access.schemas

<alarmrequest> -> :class:`AlarmRequest`

<alarmresponse> -> :class:`AlarmResponse`

<requestnewauthentication> -> :class:`NewAuthRequest`

<requestnewauthenticationresponse> -> :class:`NewAuthResponse`

<pingrequest> -> :class:`PingRequest`

<pingresponse> -> :class:`PingResponse`


Alarm Transmission
==================

<alarmrequest> is the telegram that is used when an alarm is sent to the alarm
receiver. The server responds with a <alarmresponse>


The maximum message size for a single telegram is limited to 100 000 characters
including XML- header and XML-tags.

<reference>
   |  OPTIONAL
   |  1-50 Characters
   |  This id is only a reference number/string.
      It is not treated by the receiver although it is returned in the
      <alarmresponse> and is stored in the log for trace purposes.

<authentication>
   |  SUPPLIED BY ALARM OPERATOR
   |  15 Characters
   |  Password for the alarm transmitter

<receiver>
   |  SUPPLIED BY ALARM OPERATOR
   |  1-20 Characters

      the alarm are distributed to if the alarm receiver has several monitoring
      centers.

   |  OPTIONAL
   |  23 Characters.
   |  Ex.”2002-05-28 11:35:20.022”
      Time stamp from the transmitter. Only used for log/trace.

.. todo::

   Contact SOS Alarm and double check if this only supports RFC-822 without
   timestamp.

<alarmtype>
   |  "OPTIONAL" -> If not present the receiver will assume "AL"
   |  2 Characters
   |  Indicates Alarm or Restore: "AL" = Alarm, "RE" = Restore

    </alarmresponse>


Requesting new authentication/password
======================================

Alarm receiver should implement a function to change the password.

This function should change the password after the first connection to the
alarm receiver. The new password shall be stored in the transmitter and used
here after. This prevents that and installation company or anybody else knows
the password.

This makes it very hard to setup another transmitter to send false alarms.

The new password should not be visible in the configuration interface for
the alarm transmitter.

If an error occurs during the password change, the old password will be valid
until the first message with the new password is received.

If the NOT_AUTHORIZED reply is received from transmitter the receiver should
alert the customer to take proper action. It might be necessary to contact the
alarm operators customer support for a new password.

If the transmitter is replaced a new password is required from alarm operator.

The change off password is requested with <requestnewauthentication> and the
response <requestnewauthenticationresponse> is sent back containing the new
password.

Monitored Connection
====================

Monitored connection is a function where the alarm receiver monitors that the
transmitter sends heartbeat signals on a regular basis. The alarm transmitter
is the initiating part in this function. If the receiver does not get a
heartbeat signal in the agreed interval a line fault alarm is generated to
the alarm operator.

The service is available in four different levels:

1. 25 hours (90000 seconds)
2. 5 hours (18000 seconds)
3. 180 seconds
4. 90 seconds


When using heartbeat levels 3 and 4 it is mandatory to implement failover
functionality in transmitter. If the primary receiver fails to handle the
incoming request, the transmitter should resend the alarm to failover receiver.

If the failover receiver fails as well the transmitter shall have alternative
delivery way over example GPRS or/and UMTS.

Each service level requires that at least two heartbeat signals shall be sent
within the interval.

It is recommend that the transmitter sends at least three heartbeat signals per
service level time but no more than six.


.. todo::

    There is a protection if sending <pingrequest> very shortly a after each
    other that the server responds with PING_TO_OFTEN. What is this exact
    time limit since it doesn't seem to be bound to the service level?
    Contact SOS Alarm and ask.

If heartbeat signals is sent to frequent an error message will be replied in the
ping request response (PING_TO_OFTEN).

The heartbeat is sent in a <pingrequest> and the server answers with a
<pingresponse>

The alarm receiver sends a response message after receiving the ping request.
In the response message, the time is attached; this can be used for
synchronizing the clock in the transmitter.
